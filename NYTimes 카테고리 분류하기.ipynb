       "'Good Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.\\n\\nTrade talks in peril?\\n\\nNegotiations between Washington and Beijing seemed to be in a precarious place on Tuesday, after the FT reported that the Trump administration had canceled meetings with Chinese vice ministers.\\n\\nThe officials had offered to come to Washington to prepare for meetings scheduled later this month between China’s trade czar, Liu He, and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, the FT said.\\n\\nLarry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, denied the report to CNBC. He added that negotiations would only be successful if the Chinese honored their commitments:\\n\\n“Promises are great but enforcement is what we want — things like deadlines and timetables and full coverage of the various structural issues. Will this all be solved at the end of the month? I don’t know. I wouldn’t dare to predict.”\\n\\nChina may agree to buy up to seven million tons of American wheat. But Chinese officials are reportedly chafing at U.S. requests for regular reviews of changes to their trade policies. And two influential American business groups still see reason to be unhappy, saying China is engaged in “a deep, concerted and continuing effort” to establish dominance in technologies such as robotics and electric vehicles.\\n\\nBeijing is also trying to play down Belt and Road, its vast infrastructure initiative spanning Asia, Europe and Africa: Senior government officials have avoided the topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the NYT reports.'"
